New in version 1.0.0:
- The Java CLASSPAH is used when running Kick Assembler, 
  which means you can place the KickAss.jar file anywhere, 
  as long as it exists in your CLASSPASTH environment variable
- Small fixes in language-definition correction
- Version upped to 1.0, to indicate that all basic functionality is in there and that its fairly stable
